# Mining Setup, Linux (Ubuntu)

## About

This document describes how to setup and **verify** the finn full node, wallet and be ready for mining.

## finn QT Wallet

Please note, the finn-qt-wallet available at the [Wallet Download](https://www.finn.mw/downloads) page is **not for mining**.
If you are running qt wallet or finn713, please **do not try to use it for mining**.

## Preperquisited

Install 'tree', 'curl' and 'telnet' to validate the setup
```
> sudo apt-get install curl
> sudo apt-get install telnet
> sudo apt-get install tree
```

## High level Architecture

Please check the high level connection diagram and understand the ports that are used by default. For P2P connections it is enough to have outbound connections. For Stratum protocol inbound connection are required.

![](Install_mac_images/architecture.png)

Please note IPs `127.0.0.1` are open for only local host connections. `0.0.0.0` allows anyone to connect to your host.

Please adjust IPs according to your needs and update your firewall rules.

Note: By default connections are not entrypted. If you need SSL connections you will need to configure certificates as well. It is a different topic and is not covered in this document.

## Data Location, data clean up

finn-node and finn-wallet data is located in the `~/.finn` directory.

finn-wallet data is located in the `~/.finn/main/wallet_data/` directory. The most critical piece of data is the wallet seed found at `~/.finn/main/wallet_data/wallet.seed`.

In case you want to do clean setup, you can delete all directories. Please note, you will **lose any funds in your wallet** in this case.  
```
rm -rf ~/.finn
``` 

You might need to do this to clean your setup if an error is made.

## Install of finn node and finn-wallet

In this install we will install everything at `~/my_finn_install`. All commands referred to assume this path.

Download finn node from [https://github.com/finnproject/finn-node/releases/latest]. We are assuming that the resulting file will be located at `~/Downloads/finn-node-XXXXX-linux-amd64.tar.gz`.

Download finn-wallet from [https://github.com/finnproject/finn-wallet/releases/latest]. We are assuming that the resulting file will be located at `~/Downloads/finn-wallet-XXXXX-linux-amd64.tar.gz`.

Now let's install everything into `~/my_finn_install`.

```bash
mkdir ~/my_finn_install
cd ~/my_finn_install
tar -xvf ~/Downloads/finn-node-*-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xvf ~/Downloads/finn-wallet-*-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Your output should be something like this:
```
kbay$ mkdir ~/my_finn_install
kbay$ cd ~/my_finn_install
my_finn_install kbay$ tar -xvf ~/Downloads/finn-node-*-linux-amd64.tar.gz
x finn/
x finn/finn
my_finn_install kbay$ tar -xvf ~/Downloads/finn-wallet-*-linux-amd64.tar.gz
x finn-wallet/
x finn-wallet/finn-wallet
```

Now your finn-node is located at `~/my_finn_install/finn/finn` and your finn-wallet is located at `~/my_finn_install/finn-wallet/finn-wallet`.

One common task is to send mined finn from the finn-wallet to the Qt wallet. In order to do that, the most convenient method is to use the "file based send". The finn-wallet command to send is the following:

```
# finn-wallet send -m file -d <location_to_save_file> <amount_to_send>
```

In order to receive it, you will need to click on "receive finn by file". Select the file created in the last step. A new file saved in the same location as the file from the last step will be created with the suffix .response and this file can be finalized by the finn-wallet with the following command:

```
# finn-wallet finalize -i <location_of_response_file>
```

This will allow for sending of finn from finn-wallet into the Qt wallet.

## Start the node

Start the node for the first run.
```
kbay$ ~/my_finn_install/finn/finn
```

![](Install_mac_images/scr_node.png)


finn-node has few commands. Run `~/my_finn_install/finn/finn help` to explore them.

Please keep your node running until we setup the wallet. You should be able to see that the node was able connect to the peers and download the chain.


#### Validate the node install

Please check that the node was able to create the files and download the data.

Check the files.
```

``` 

Please note the location of the:

log file: `~/.finn/finn-server.log`  
config: `~/.finn/finn-server.toml`

Meanwhile feel free to check the logs at `~/.finn/finn-server.log`

If everything goes well, you shouldn't see anything logged at the "ERROR" level. Output from the following command should be empty
```
>  cat ~/.finn/main/finn-server.log | grep 'ERROR'
``` 

**Note: It is expected that a single node and wallet only are running per host!** 
If you try to run several instances, you will likely to see some errors.  

You will need to wait a while for the node to download the blockchain data. When the download is complete, the UI will show the following: `Current Status: Running`.
If you see this status, congratulations, your node is running. We can start with a wallet setup.

## Init wallet

If you don't have an finn-wallet instance, you will need to create a new one. Please note, if you already have an finn-wallet instance, you can restore it through mnemonic or seed file. It is covered below.
 
Let's explore first what finn-wallet can do by running:

```

#### Validation

Please validate that your wallet created the files:

```
kbay$ tree ~/.finn
~/.finn
└── main
    ├── finn-wallet.log
    ├── finn-wallet.toml
    └── wallet_data
        ├── db
        │   └── lmdb
        │       ├── data.mdb
        │       └── lock.mdb
        ├── saved_txs
        └── wallet.seed
```    

Please note the location of the:

logs : `~/.finn/finn-wallet.log`  
config: `~/.finn/finn-wallet.toml`

Confirm that there were no errors during wallet initialization:

```
>  cat ~/.finn/main/finn-wallet.log | grep 'ERROR'
```

## Start Listener for the Wallet

In order to mine, finn-wallet needs to be run in listening mode. The wallet will build the coinbase transaction for the blocks that your miner mines.

```
kbay$ ~/my_finn_install/finn-wallet/finn-wallet listen
Password:
20191111 18:59:15.332 WARN finn_wallet_controller::controller - Starting HTTP Foreign listener API server at 127.0.0.1:3415.
20191111 18:59:15.333 WARN finn_wallet_controller::controller - HTTP Foreign listener started.
```
And your wallet will run until you interrupt it.

Congratulations, if you pass validation, your wallet is ready. Please keep it running for the duration of the time you are mining.

#### Validate

Please periodically check if logs don't have errors with:
```
> cat ~/.finn/main/finn-wallet.log | grep 'ERROR'
```

Check if Foreign listener API runs well with the command:
```
kbay$  curl -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "build_coinbase", "id": 1, "params": { "block_fees": 7000000}}' http://localhost:3415/v2/foreign
{
  "error": {
    "code": -32602,
    "message": "InvalidArgStructure \"block_fees\" at position 0."
  },
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0"
}
```

## Setup finn-node to run miner locally

Please update config for your finn-node.

- Stop finn-node if it is running. Please let finn-wallet run in listening mode.
- Edit `~/.finn/main/finn-server.toml` with your favorite editor.

Change the value for `enable_stratum_server` to 
```
#whether stratum server is enabled
enable_stratum_server = true
``` 
- Start finn-node
```
kbay$ ~/my_finn_install/finn/finn
``` 

You are ready to to run your miner locally on the same host.

#### Validate

Check if there any errors are in the node logs
```
>  cat ~/.finn/main/finn-server.log | grep 'ERROR'
```

Check if stratum is activated. The following line will be present in your log file if your node is configured correctly:
```
> cat ~/.finn/main/finn-server.log | grep 'Stratum server started'
20191111 19:32:36.088 WARN finn_servers::mining::stratumserver - Stratum server started on 127.0.0.1:3416
```

Verify that stratum is configured correctly with telnet:
```
kbay$ telnet  127.0.0.1 3416
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
{"id":"Stratum","jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"job","params":{"difficulty":1,"height":966,"job_id":1,"pre_pow":"000100000000000003c6000000005dca285900001d1246f8704600e3ff43c46eb36ff54493004b517ce12a4a22009e74336feac7d18ccd2b1b6a3b84381f9d7e65ad9d83ab7d9f6844a1761d301e4fa30d4af0bfbf06792019ed7e234b0a8a7528d4c46d8f130a9055c0055fc1e3ab51215f6a6cf5035c865ec1320221fdace2a63ed83db57eebea06a195a5ebfb1b06713028a1bf87cc76007cec679dc7cc6650610a16c00c326ed16be15e3d47dbf311880000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000078700000000000007870000000bbb860467000001a0"}}
^C
Connection closed by foreign host.
```


## Setup finn-node to run a miner on a different host

Please update the config for your finn-node.

- Stop finn-node if it is running. Please let finn-wallet run in listening mode.
- Edit `~/.finn/finn-server.toml` with your favorite editor.

Change the value for `enable_stratum_server` and `stratum_server_addr` 
```
#whether stratum server is enabled
enable_stratum_server = true

#what port and address for the stratum server to listen on
stratum_server_addr = "0.0.0.0:3416"
``` 
stratum_server_addr needs to listen on 0.0.0.0 in order to accept connections from other hosts.

- Start finn-node
```
kbay$ ~/my_finn_install/finn/finn
``` 

#### Validate node from local host

Check if there are any errors in the node logs
```
>  cat ~/.finn/main/finn-server.log | grep 'ERROR'
```

Check if stratum is activated. The following line will be present in your log file if your node is configured correctly:
```
> cat ~/.finn/main/finn-server.log | grep 'Stratum server started'
20191111 19:32:36.088 WARN finn_servers::mining::stratumserver - Stratum server started on 0.0.0.0:3416
```

Verify that stratum is configured correctly with telnet:
```
kbay$ telnet  127.0.0.1 3416
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
{"id":"Stratum","jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"job","params":{"difficulty":1,"height":966,"job_id":1,"pre_pow":"000100000000000003c6000000005dca285900001d1246f8704600e3ff43c46eb36ff54493004b517ce12a4a22009e74336feac7d18ccd2b1b6a3b84381f9d7e65ad9d83ab7d9f6844a1761d301e4fa30d4af0bfbf06792019ed7e234b0a8a7528d4c46d8f130a9055c0055fc1e3ab51215f6a6cf5035c865ec1320221fdace2a63ed83db57eebea06a195a5ebfb1b06713028a1bf87cc76007cec679dc7cc6650610a16c00c326ed16be15e3d47dbf311880000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000078700000000000007870000000bbb860467000001a0"}}
^C
Connection closed by foreign host.
```

#### Obtain my public IP.

Your miner will need to initiate a connection to your public IP. You can get your Public IP from the following site  [https://whatismypublicip.com/]

Please store your IP, you will need it to setup your miner and validate the setup.

#### Open port at Linux

Ensure the port is open and not being blocked by the firewall. 
The easiest way is to disable the firewall.

#### Do you have a router? Map 3416 port for incoming connections

If you have a router you need to setup the port forwarding for incoming connections.

If you don't know how to do that, please do the search for the phrase: how to setup 'router brand' port forwarding.   
For example: `how to setup Negtgear port forwarding`  will return you a link  
[https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/setting-port-forwarding-netgear-router-genie-firmware/]

We recommend you just map your router port 3416 to your device local IP address.  

Here is how you can find your local IP for Ubuntu [https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/net-findip.html.en]

#### Validate if your port is open for INCOMING connections

Please verify that Port Tester shows that your port is open:
[https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/]

Here is how it looks when I didn't open port at my router, didn't disable firewall, or didn't run finn-node with a proper setup.

![](Install_mac_images/port_close.png)

Here how it looks like when I did everything properly.

![](Install_mac_images/port_open.png)

**Please note! It doesn't make sense to continue with miner if your port is not open!** This tool works well and if your port is closed it means that the
 router, firewall or finn-node are not configured correctly. 
 
#### Validate stratum connection from your miner's host

If you can ssh to the miner host, please validate with telnet is miner can access the node:
```
kbay$ telnet  <finn_NODE_PUBLIC_IP> 3416
Trying 24.4.197.142...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
{"id":"Stratum","jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"job","params":{"difficulty":1,"height":966,"job_id":1,"pre_pow":"000100000000000003c6000000005dca285900001d1246f8704600e3ff43c46eb36ff54493004b517ce12a4a22009e74336feac7d18ccd2b1b6a3b84381f9d7e65ad9d83ab7d9f6844a1761d301e4fa30d4af0bfbf06792019ed7e234b0a8a7528d4c46d8f130a9055c0055fc1e3ab51215f6a6cf5035c865ec1320221fdace2a63ed83db57eebea06a195a5ebfb1b06713028a1bf87cc76007cec679dc7cc6650610a16c00c326ed16be15e3d47dbf311880000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000078700000000000007870000000bbb860467000001a0"}}
^C
Connection closed by foreign host.
```
  
#### Node setup is DONE for access from the internet.

Congratulations, if you pass all validation steps, you are done with setup for finn-node and finn node. 
You can finish miner setup.


## MINER

There are many miner that you can run. finn miner 100% compartible with finn miner. If you are mining for finn, just redirect to finn node.

#### finn miner

finn clone of finn miner you can get here [https://github.com/finnproject/finn-miner]
Please follow the instruction how to set it up.

#### GMiner

If you are rinning GMiner please run.
User name can have any value. You will see your miner in the finn-node console under this name.

Your server IP should be 127.0.0.1 if you run your miner on the same host that you run finn node and finn-wallet.
Or you should use your finn-node public IP if it is run on different host. Please check that your port is open and 'Validate stratum connection from your miner side' is passed.

To run in C31 mode:
```
miner.exe --algo finn31 --server <NODE_IP>  --port 3416 --user WhatEverName
```
OR for C29d:
```
miner.exe --algo cuckarood29 --server <NODE_IP> --port 3416 --user WhatEverName
```

## Checking your coins

You might want to check how much coins you was able to main and see the output.

You can view the balance with `info` command
```
~/my_finn_install/finn-wallet/finn-wallet info
```

You can check your outputs with `outputs`
```
~/my_finn_install/finn-wallet/finn-wallet output
```
