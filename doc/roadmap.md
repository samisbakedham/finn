- Alternative node implementation. We can port finn++ and have simplified node that validate concensus only. 
- Mobile node.

- Multisig.
- Minimize transactions traceability (Coinjoin pool)

There are many potential places development resources can be allocated. They will be chosen based on market needs. Highest priority will be given to requests that primarily benefit and come from the buyers and hodlers of last resort.
