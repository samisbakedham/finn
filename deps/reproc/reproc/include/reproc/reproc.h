Simplifies calling combinations of `reproc_wait`, `reproc_terminate` and

`reproc_wait`) until the corresponding timeout expires before continuing with
the next step.

Example:

Wait 10 seconds for the child process to exit on its own before sending
`SIGTERM` (POSIX) or `CTRL-BREAK` (Windows) and waiting five more seconds for
the child process to exit.

```c
REPROC_ERROR error = reproc_stop(process,
                                 REPROC_STOP_WAIT, 10000,

                                 REPROC_STOP_NOOP, 0);
```

Call `reproc_wait`, `reproc_terminate` and `reproc_kill` directly if you need
extra logic such as logging between calls.

(`c1`,`t1`), (`c2`,`t2`) and (`c3`,`t3`) are pairs that instruct `reproc_stop`
how to stop a process. The first element of each pair instructs `reproc_stop` to
execute the corresponding function to stop the process. The second element of
each pair tells `reproc_stop` how long to wait after executing the function
indicated by the first element.

status can be retrieved with `reproc_exit_status`.
