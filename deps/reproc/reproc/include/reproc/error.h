/*!
reproc's error enum. Contains all errors that may be returned by reproc's API.
Because `REPROC_SUCCESS` evaluates to zero it is possible to check for errors as
follows:

```c
REPROC_ERROR error = reproc_read(...);
if (error) { // Only passes if `reproc_read` returns an error.
  return error;
}
```
*/
// When editing make sure to change the corresponding enum in error.hpp as well.
typedef enum {
  /*! Indicates a reproc API call was successful. An API function return this
  value if no error occurs during its execution. */

  // reproc-specific errors. These are not necessarily fatal errors and should
  // be handled separately.

  /*! A timeout value passed to an API function expired. */
  REPROC_ERROR_WAIT_TIMEOUT,
  /*! The child process closed one of its streams (and in the case of
  stdout/stderr all of the data from that stream has been read). */

/*!
Returns the last system error code.

On Windows this function returns the result of `GetLastError`. On POSIX systems
this function returns the value of `errno`. The value is not saved so other
functions that modify the results of `GetLastError` or `errno` should not be
called if you want to retrieve the last system error that occurred in one of
reproc's API functions.

On POSIX systems, if an error occurs after `fork` but before `exec` it is
communicated to the parent process which sets its own `errno` value to the
`errno` value of the child process. This makes it possible to retrieve errors
that happen after forking with this function (for example in `chdir` or `exec`).
